# Introduction

The augmented reality application that was designed and discussed in this document, was designed to visually relay information from a  Festo Cyber physical factory. The design of the application included creating a Digital Twin simulation that would simulate the real world Festo Cyber physical factory, tracking of carts and linking of orders from the Festo machine database.
